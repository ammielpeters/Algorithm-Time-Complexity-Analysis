# Algorithm Time Complexity Analysis

This project analyzes the execution time of different algorithms in C and compares them with their theoretical Big-O complexities.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Linear Search (O(n))
- Bubble Sort (O(nÂ²))
- Binary Search (O(log n))

## Input Sizes
- n = 10, 100, 1000, 5000

## How to Run
```bash
gcc complexity_analysis.c -o complexity
./complexity
